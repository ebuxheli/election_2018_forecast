* Republicans will keep both the Senate and the House
** Republicans will hold 53 seats in the Senate
** Republicans will hold 218 seats in the House

I believe that while there may have been a great movement in the Democratic party to push for more young voters to go out and vote in the midterms that there will not be enough power behind it to swing the power from a GOP majority in both the House and the Senate. Trump has been actively campaigning throughout his time as presidency and going to states throughout the country trying to win over voters, and I think that he has done a good job of convincing these people to go out to vote. Additionally, the Democrats have to overcome the fact that they must overturn seats from incumbents in order to gain the majority in the House. 

Trump's campaigning in vital swing states such as Florida, Missouri, and West Virginia will result in the Republican party holding on to their current seats in the House and Senate.
