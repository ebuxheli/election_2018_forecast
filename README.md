* Republicans will keep both the Senate and the House
  - Republicans will hold 53 seats in the Senate
  - Republicans will hold 218 seats in the House

While there may have been a great movement by the Democratic party to motivate younger voters to go out and cast their ballots, it won't be enough to swing either the House or Senate away from a GOP majority. The polling data currently being used for election predictions has been misleading as it currently shows a Democratic House of Representatives win and will be turned on its head when the silent Republicans go out to place their votes. 

Trump has been actively campaigning during his presidency for GOP candidates as he tries to improve his approval ratings and win over voters across the country. Trump, as the figurehead of the Republican party, has been doing his part to uphold his campaign promises. The economy has been doing well, unemployment is low, and there have been tax cuts implemented which means that voters are more likely to be satisfied with the current leadership. 

Democrats face the uphill battle of overturning Republican incumbent seats in the Senate and the battle for the House seems like it will be a close one. Trump's campaigning in key toss-up states such as Florida, Missouri, and West Virginia just might be enough to ensure that the Republicans can hold on to power for the remainder of his term.
